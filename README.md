## Tweet Snipper

A simple web tool built using next.js and twitter API that allows users to capture tweets, customize the appearance using the built in editor and export it as an image.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/tweet/[tweet-id]](http://localhost:3000/api/tweet/[tweet-id]). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/tweet/[id].js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
